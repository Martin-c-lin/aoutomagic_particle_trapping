Try to make a single API on which one can build other applications.
Have c_p as input to the different threads and put the threads in separate files.
EX - temperature thread in temperature_controller file.

Make it possible to build different applications on using these basic building blocks.

Consider splitting c_p into different subdictionaries, one per thread.
Then we would have for instance c_p_temperature(),c_p_camera etc
